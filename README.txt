These programs were made for a thesis that is focused in the area of Systems Engineering, and had as objective 
the design of a control and monitoring system for the automation of the processes of a hydrocarbon oily water treatment package 
using a programmable logic controller (PLC). The system executes automatic actions for the operation of the process and 
its logic was written in ladder language (Ladder), this has a monitoring through a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) panel 
which has an online visualization achieving more accurate measurements of variables and operator safety. The IEC 61131-3 standard
 was used as a support for this work. The ladder programming logic was developed in the programming environment for PLC's, 
ISPsoft, and for the development of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) the DOPsoft program was used, both from Delta Electronics. 
A good integration between the logic developed in Ladder and the HMI was achieved, visualizing the process in operative operation.
 In order to use the two programs together, it is necessary to download and install the COMMGR program from Delta Electronics.
